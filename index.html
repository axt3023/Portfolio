                        Hi there, and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Anup Tiwari, and I am a passionate and dedicated cybersecurity professional with strong background in 
                      defensive cybersecurity. I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems from the University of Texas at Arlington in May 2023.
                       Recently, I worked as a Cybersecurity Analyst intern at Costco's Logging and Detection Engineering Department, where I have had the opportunity to work with Splunk and explore other cybersecurity teams such as SOC, Incident Response, and Endpoint Security. Additionally, I have gained valuable experience as a Consulting Engineering Associate intern at Heartland Business Systems and a Technology Assistant at the University of Texas at Arlington's Human Resources Department.
I enjoy the challenge of troubleshooting and have a strong ability to work well with both technical and non-technical individuals. While I am a self-learner at heart, 
I also enjoy collaborating and working on challenges as a team. I strongly believe in continually expanding my knowledge and skill set by exposing myself to new 
challenges and environments.Currently, I am pursuing the Cyber Defense and SOC Analyst Level 1 path on TryHackMe to further develop my Blue Team cybersecurity skills.
   I am always eager to learn and excited about what the future holds in the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity. Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!

                            Created a honeypot in Azure with super exposed virtual machines and used powershell scripts to extract metadata
                            from Windows Event Viewer to be forwarded to third party API to derive geolocation data. Configured log Analytics workspace
                            in Azure to ingest custom logs containing geographic information and Azure Sentinnel (Microsoft's Cloud SIEM) to display global RDP Brute Force attack in Map.
